### Hi there 👋
I'm Liam, an Australia based software engineer who is passionate about open source. My favourite technologies at the moment are dotnet and Typescript!  
- 🐶 That strapping young lad in my profile picture is Banjo! He's responsible for making sure I keep a healthy work life balance (walks, treats, play should never be neglected)
